2. Predicting Antibiotic Resistance with Machine Learning
	•	Objective: Create a model to predict antibiotic resistance in A. baumannii based on genetic mutations in the OmpA gene.
	•	Steps:
	•	Obtain A. baumannii genomes and their resistance profiles.
	•	Extract features from OmpA, such as mutations, sequence motifs, or structural features.
	•	Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) to predict resistance phenotypes.
	•	Use a dataset like CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) for labels.
	•	CS Skills: Machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

1. OmpA Sequence Analysis Tool
	•	Objective: Develop a Python or R tool to analyze the OmpA gene’s sequence and its variations in different Acinetobacter baumannii strains.
	•	Steps:
	•	Collect Acinetobacter baumannii genomic data containing the OmpA gene from databases like NCBI or EMBL.
	•	Use bioinformatics libraries such as Biopython or seqinr to extract and align sequences.
	•	Identify conserved regions and mutations.
	•	Visualize sequence similarity using tools like heatmaps or phylogenetic trees.
	•	CS Skills: Data parsing, sequence alignment, and visualization.

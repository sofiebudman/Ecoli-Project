# AMR

I first used NCBI an seared for the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene in different strains

Then I processed these into an R fasta file using the ape package

then I saved it as a .txt file and annotated it with the corresponding strain name

I used several packages to align the sequences and view the sequence alignment

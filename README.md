# Ecoli

Using data from NCBI and UCI Machine Learning Database on E. Coli strains and potential genes. Implemented computational biology tools and created a predictive model.

/multiple_sequence_alignment: Code for sequence alignment of E. coli genes from NCBI. 

/phylogenetic_trees: Create phylogenetic trees of different strains of E. coli

/orf_localization: predict locations of potential genes of E. coli using UCI dataset
